# Photopea Offline

## Why I made this
The creator of [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), a great free alternative to Photoshop, is not interested on making an offline version, so I took it upon myself to make it.

## Issues
If there are any issues, please let me know.

## How to use
1. Download the repository
